# DIALOGS
This is a collection of scripts that use Minecraft's new [**Dialog**](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dialog) feature.

All of these scripts will require [**SkNMS**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkNMS) 1.3.0+ and a Paper 1.21.6+ server.

See the [**SkNMS Dialog Wiki**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/SkNMS/wiki/Dialog-Registration) for more info.
