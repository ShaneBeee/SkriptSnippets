These snippets are to showcase how to use custom enchantments in Skript.

As of Minecraft 1.21, custom enchantments can be registered via datapacks.

All of the custom enchantments here use my [**Beer**](https://github.com/ShaneBeee/Beer) datapack.      
You can obviously make your own datapack and create your own custom enchantments.     
This is strictly to show you the things you can do.
