# Sorted Tablists
# By: ShaneBee

# This simple script allows you to sort your players in tablist based on their rank.
# This uses the vanilla team system via simple console commands.


# Function to register a new team and set it's prefix/suffix
function registerTeam(name: string, prefix: string, suffix: string):
	execute console command "/team add %{_name}%"
	if length of {_prefix} > 0:
		execute console command "/team modify %{_name}% prefix ""%{_prefix}% """
	if length of {_suffix} > 0:
		execute console command "/team modify %{_name}% suffix ""%{_suffix}% """

# Function to join a player to a team
function joinTeam(player: player, team: string):
	execute console command "/team leave %{_player}%" # We do this to prevent being on more than 1 team
	execute console command "/team join %{_team}% %{_player}%"


# When the server loads we will register our teams
# Subsequent loads, this will throw some warnings in the console
# You can either ignore these, or remove this section of code once teams are registered
on skript load:
	# We use a, b, c to rank our teams from highest to lowest
	# You can name the team whatever you want but they will show up in
	# the tablist in alphabetical order
	registerTeam("a", "&7[&aOWNER&7]", "")
	registerTeam("b", "&7[&cADMIN&7]", "")
	registerTeam("c", "&7[&bMOD&7]", "")
	registerTeam("d", "&7[&7PLAYER&7]", "")

# When the player joins, let's add them to the appropriate team
# Use whatever permissions you see fit
on join:
	wait 1 tick
	if player has permission "rank.owner":
		joinTeam(player, "a")
	else if player has permission "rank.admin":
		joinTeam(player, "b")
	else if player has permission "rank.mod":
		joinTeam(player, "c")
	else:
		joinTeam(player, "d")
